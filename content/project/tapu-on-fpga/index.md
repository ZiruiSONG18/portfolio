I joined in a group that develops a novel **Transmission-Analytics Processing Unit** (TAPU), which can switch, in runtime, between different modes on the same hardware chip.

To develop this TAPU, we adopted a dual-image FPGA, which is an integrated circuit that can provide hardware acceleration.

In this group, I touched some quite new edges of this field and learned how to research certain topics and how to handle such a project. It helped me gained much experience.

I would like to share with you our demonstration video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXK5OcrP_mY
