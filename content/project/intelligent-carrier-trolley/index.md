A group containing with groupmates coming from different majors focuses on this project that we would like to produce an intelligent carrier trolley with different controlling modes. I would like to share this interesting process by 3 satges.

**Stage 1**

At first we did not clearly know what we should do step by step to achieve our final goals. So, we decided to start thinking about what the hierarchy of the project would be like and try to provide as many configuration solution as we can. We thought up of 5 different solutions of configuration and listed their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we considered some different modules we need to care about in this project, and determine their different priorities. Though they were quite raw thoughts with little realistic restricting conditions, this process led us to be gradually clear about what we should do.

Stage 1 nearly continued for 3 weeks with a path that is not so fast. We basically finished all parts of pre-design and we earned some great ideas from other projects. This stage built firm fundamentals for our project, especially in the part of deciding how to conduct our project step by step.

**Stage 2**

The second stage is the most time-consuming one
